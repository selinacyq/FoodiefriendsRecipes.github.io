    <p>It is my pleasure to introduce myself once more. Jocelyn Chang Ai Yin is my name, and I'm from Kuching, Sarawak. This year, I want to expand my knowledge and learn new things. At the same time, I also want to talk more about my love for food as an outcome.  I like to read and watch videos as hobbies.

You may find a treasure trove of unique recipes on my websites, ranging from classic family favourites to cutting-edge cuisines. I want to provide options for everyone and inspire you to get in the kitchen and experiment with flavours. In my opinion, food has the ability to bind people together and foster a sense of community.
