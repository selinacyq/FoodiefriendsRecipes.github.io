      <h1 id="vegan_mapo_tofu">Vegan Mapo Tofu</h1>
      <img src="images/vegan_mapo_tofu.jpg" alt="mapo_tofu">
      <p>Vegan Mapo Tofu is a plant-based variation of the traditional Sichuan dish. It emerged as a vegan-friendly alternative to accommodate dietary preferences and restrictions. This version typically replaces the minced meat with ingredients like mushrooms or textured vegetable protein while retaining the signature spicy and savory flavors.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 or 5 dried shiitake mushroom</li>
        <li>Moderate amount of salt</li>
        <li>14 to 16 ounces (390 to 450 grams) of firm tofu, cut into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of potato starch</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons of whole peppercorns</li>
        <li>5 dried red chiles, cut into 3/4-inch segments and seeds shaken out</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of peeled and miced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of fermented black beans, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2½ tablespoons of chili bean paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of chili flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced, for garnish</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of ground peppercorns</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Rehydrate the mushrooms with soak it in hot water for 30 minutes, then drain, stem and finely chop them.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil a pot of salted water. Reduce the heat to low, add the tofu cubes, and simmer gently for 10 minutes to refresh the tofu's flavors and firm it up.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make a slurry by combining the starch with ¼ cup cold water in a small bowl. Stir until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a wok over medium heat until a bead of water evaporates immediately upon contact. Add the oil, swirling to the coat sides of the wok. Reduce the heat to low. Add the whole Sichuan peppercorns and dried chiles and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes to infuse the oil with flavor, until the chiles are slightly darkened in color and aromatic. Do not burn them. Remove from the heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard the spices, leaving behind the aromatic oil.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Return the wok to medium-high heat and add the mushrooms, ginger, and garlic. Fry for 1 minute, until the mushrooms are beginning to brown. Scoot them up one side of the wok.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the fermented black beans, chili bean paste, and ground chile and stir-fry briefly for 10 seconds to release their fragrance. Pour in the stock, then add sugar and soy sauce. Bring the liquid to a boil. Lift the tofu cubes from the hot water with a slotted spoon and place them gently in the wok. To keep them from breaking, don’t stir; instead, move the wok in a swirling motion, shifting the sauce as it bubbles under the tofu. Bring to a full boil.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Give the starch slurry a stir and drizzle about a third of it into the wok, swirling the wok gently to mix in the slurry as the liquid thickens. Repeat this two more times, until the sauce is glossy and clings to the tofu, then remove the wok from the heat and transfer everything to a serving dish. Sprinkle with the scallions and the ground peppercorns (these provide the tingly mouthfeel) and serve.</li>
      </ol>
